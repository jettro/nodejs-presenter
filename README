With this project I want to create a very basic web based presentation application. No I am not going to recreate Keynote or Powerpoint. I want this to be a very command line driven presentation application.

Features
- Create a base template with headers and footers
- Add the option to apply another template to a slide
- Add command line interface on every page to interact with the slides. Initial commands available are:
  - Next slide
  - Previous slide
  - Goto slide
- Add basic elements for a slide
  - Bullet list
  - Title
  - image
  - table
  - link
